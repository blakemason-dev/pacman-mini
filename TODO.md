# To Do

- Assign all server game objects transform data
- Make the screen coordinate converter a bit more generic (should really 
be something called by the client in case we build something without a server)
- fix arena corners
- prevent obstacles from generating over the portal
- prevent obstacles generating out of bounds
- add mini pacman generator
- add scoreboard
- ensure no state can be changed from client side
- prevent "trying to encode "NaN" in sVector2#x" error
- fix 'webgl context was lost' error so i can use WEBGL and tints
- optimize the texture switch code so it doesn't update every loop for pacmen
- add player 2
- ~~make pacmen change colour based on who following~~
- ~~add mini pacmen with follow system~~
- ~~add rescue portal~~
- ~~make wall obstacles that form the level~~
